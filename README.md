### ✍️ **Make your changes**

Work on your version **locally**

1. Create a folder named `data` (⚠️ all lowercase) in your **local copy** of the repository
2. Copy the three RDM datasets to this `data` folder.
3. ⚠️ Double-check that `data/` is included in the `.gitignore` file, to make sure these datasets are not accidentally pushed to the GitHub server.
4. Check that the three datasets in the data folder **do not appear** in GitHub Desktop. This is normal — the folder is excluded because it is listed in the `.gitignore` file.
5. Edit the code as needed to complete your tasks.

### 📤 Commit & push regularly

1. Save your changes with *Commit"
